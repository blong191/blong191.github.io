            <p>I perfer to do things that require logic and when I can predict what will happen.
              I also love computers and the internet in general.
              I esentualy grew up around computers wondering what it takes to make them work.

          <p>I never saw myself as an intresting person. I've never done anything increadably crazy or acheved something no one else has.

            <h2>Background in Tech</h2>
            <p>I took a class in highschool that introduced me to the idea of programing.
              from this I then decided to prosue this love further by aplying to Thaddeus Steavens College.
              This is where I am currently at.
              The corses so far have been fun.
              After graduating I will be looking around for enployment and based on the statistics of the school I should have no problem finding it.
