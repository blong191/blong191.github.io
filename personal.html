            <h2>Programming love</h2>
            <p>I prefer to do things that require logic and when I can predict what will happen.
              I also love computers and the internet in general.
              I essentially grew up around computers wondering what it takes to make them work.

          <h2>Personal Life</h2>
          <p>I never saw myself as an interesting person. I've never done anything incredibly crazy or achieved something no one else has.
            I hope to change that.

            <h2>Background in Tech</h2>
            <p>I took a class in high school that introduced me to the idea of programming.
              From this, I then decided to pursue this love further by applying to Thaddeus Stevens College.
              This is where I am currently at.
              The courses so far have been fun.
              After graduating I will be looking around for employment and based on the statistics of the school I should have no problem finding it.
